## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and predict sales data using time series regression techniques. The dataset consists of historical sales records with various features such as promotions, oil prices, and transaction details.

## Table of Contents
1. **Project Overview**
   - This project explores historical store sales data to develop predictive models for future sales forecasting. Leveraging data from Favorita, the goal is to optimize inventory management and gain valuable insights into sales patterns.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - *Line Chart for 'onpromotion'*
     - A line chart depicting the distribution of 'onpromotion' values over time reveals an increasing trend during promotional periods, indicating potential impacts on sales.

   - *Resampling On Promotion Data*
     - Resampling 'onpromotion' data may be necessary to align with the desired time granularity, ensuring accurate representation and analysis.

   - *Sales Over Time*
     - Sales exhibit a generally increasing trend with periodic fluctuations, possibly influenced by external factors. Further analysis is needed to identify underlying patterns.

   - *Oil Prices Over Time*
     - The time series plot of oil prices provides insights into potential correlations with sales trends, guiding future analyses on external factors affecting sales.

   - *Correlation Matrix*
     - The correlation matrix reveals relationships between key variables, aiding in feature selection and understanding the dynamics of the dataset.

   - *Sales Distribution Across Columns*
     - Analyzing sales distribution across different categories or features helps identify high-performing areas and potential areas for improvement.

   - *Missing Values*
     - Missing values have been addressed, ensuring the integrity of the dataset for analysis.

3. **Stationarity Testing (KPSS)**
   - The KPSS test indicates the time series data. This is crucial for time series analysis, ensuring reliable predictions.

4. **Answering Business Questions**
   - *Top 10 Stores by Sales*
     - The top 10 stores by sales are [list of stores]. Stores emerges as the highest performer, contributing significantly to overall sales.

   - *Top 5 Product Families*
     - The top 5 product families driving sales. These families play a pivotal role in shaping sales patterns.

   - *Dates with Lowest and Highest Sales Each Year*
     - The dates with the lowest and highest sales for each year are [list of dates]. This information aids in understanding seasonality and planning promotional events.



   - *Correlation Between Promotions and Sales*
     - There is a positive correlation between promotions and sales, indicating the effectiveness of promotional activities.

5. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - *Impact of Promotional Periods on Sales*
     - Null Hypothesis: There is no significant impact of promotional periods on sales.
     - Alternative Hypothesis: Promotional periods have a significant impact on sales.
     - [Results and interpretation of hypothesis testing]

6. **Feature Processing/Engineering**
   - Feature selection and engineering. Selected features , considering their impact on sales.

7. **Data Splitting**
